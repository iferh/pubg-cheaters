# Is cheating in games socially contagious?
The project studied the social contagion of cheating using match data from the MMO game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). The goal of the project was to test the hypothesis that players who are killed in the game by cheaters become likely to adopt cheating themselves.

Using Python, we created simulations of alternative scenarios for the network of killers and victims of every match and compared it with the data from the real matches. The findings allowed to reject the hypothesis of contagion of cheating.
